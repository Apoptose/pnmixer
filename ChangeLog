Changes from the previous version;

 - This application now interfaces with ALSA rather than OSS as
   the oss mixer device will not allow access to theu range of
   the Master volume channel in future versions of ubuntu.
 - As interfacing with ALSA slows the application down, volume
   changes now only take affect when the scale is released.


Friday 28 August 2009 -

Initial version created/realesed based on the code from AbsVolume,
which was written by Paul Sherman and Rob Eberts.

Changes from the previous program which have taken place include;

 - New UI similar to gnomes mixer applet.
 - New callbacks such as close/hide when focus is lost.
 - Mixer now uses the master control to enable compatibility
   with pulse audio as well as alsa.
 - New Icons which indicate if mute is enabled
 - Program now calls pavucontrol rather than alsa mixer but
   this will be configurable in future versions.
